title: Agent Loops
description: Supported computer-using agent loops and models
---

An agent can be thought of as a loop - it generates actions, executes them, and repeats until done:

1. **Generate**: Your `model` generates `output_text`, `computer_call`, `function_call`
2. **Execute**: The `computer` safely executes those items
3. **Complete**: If the model has no more calls, it's done!

To run an agent loop simply do:

```python
from agent import ComputerAgent
from computer import Computer

computer = Computer() # Connect to a cua container

agent = ComputerAgent(
    model="anthropic/claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022",
    tools=[computer]
)

prompt = "open github, navigate to trycua/cua"

async for result in agent.run(prompt):
    if result["output"][-1]["type"] == "message":
        print("Agent:", result["output"][-1]["content"][0]["text"])
```

We currently support 4 computer-using agent loops:

- Anthropic CUAs
- OpenAI CUA Preview
- UI-TARS 1.5
- Omniparser + LLMs

For a full list of supported models and configurations, see the [Supported Agents](./supported-agents) page.

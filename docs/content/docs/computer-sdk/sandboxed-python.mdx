You can run Python functions securely inside a sandboxed virtual environment on a remote Cua Computer. This is useful for executing untrusted user code, isolating dependencies, or providing a safe environment for automation tasks.

## How It Works

The `sandboxed` decorator from the Computer SDK wraps a Python function so that it is executed remotely in a specified virtual environment on the target Computer. The function and its arguments are serialized, sent to the remote, and executed in isolation. Results or errors are returned to the caller.

## Example Usage

```python
from computer import Computer
from computer.helpers import sandboxed

@sandboxed()
def read_file(location: str) -> str:
    """Read contents of a file"""
    with open(location, 'r') as f:
        return f.read()

async def main():
    async with Computer(os_type="linux", provider_type="cloud", name="my-container", api_key="...") as computer:
        # Call the sandboxed function (runs remotely)
        result = await read_file("/etc/hostname")
        print(result)
```

## Installing Python Packages

You can specify the virtual environment name and target computer:

```python
@sandboxed(venv_name="myenv", computer=my_computer, max_retries=5)
def my_function(...):
    ...
```

You can also install packages in the virtual environment using the `venv_install` method:

```python
await my_computer.venv_install("myenv", ["requests"])
```

## Error Handling

If the remote execution fails, the decorator will retry up to `max_retries` times. If all attempts fail, the last exception is raised locally.

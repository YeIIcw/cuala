Lume is a lightweight Command Line Interface and local API server for creating, running and managing **macOS and Linux virtual machines** with near-native performance on Apple Silicon, using Apple's [Virtualization.Framework](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/virtualization).

## Quick Start

Install and run a prebuilt macOS VM in two commands:

```bash
# Install Lume
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/trycua/cua/main/libs/lume/scripts/install.sh)"
# Pull & start a macOS image
lume run macos-sequoia-vanilla:latest
```

> **Security Note**: All prebuilt images use the default password `lume`. Change this immediately after your first login using the `passwd` command.

**System Requirements**:
- Apple Silicon Mac (M1, M2, M3, etc.)
- macOS 13.0 or later
- At least 8GB of RAM (16GB recommended)
- At least 50GB of free disk space

## Install

Install with a single command:

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/trycua/cua/main/libs/lume/scripts/install.sh)"
```

By default, Lume is installed as a background service that starts automatically on login. If you prefer to start the Lume API service manually when needed, you can use the `--no-background-service` option:

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/trycua/cua/main/libs/lume/scripts/install.sh) --no-background-service"
```

> **Note:** With this option, you'll need to manually start the Lume API service by running `lume serve` in your terminal whenever you need to use tools or libraries that rely on the Lume API (such as the Computer-Use Agent).

You can also download the `lume.pkg.tar.gz` archive from the [latest release](https://github.com/trycua/cua/releases?q=lume&expanded=true), extract it, and install the package manually.

## Using Lume

Once installed, you can start using Lume with these common workflows:

### Run a Prebuilt VM

```bash
# Run a macOS Sequoia VM
lume run macos-sequoia-vanilla:latest

# Run an Ubuntu VM
lume run ubuntu-noble-vanilla:latest
```

> We provide [prebuilt VM images](#prebuilt-images) in our [ghcr registry](https://github.com/orgs/trycua/packages).

### Create a Custom VM

```bash
# Create a new macOS VM
lume create my-macos-vm --cpu 4 --memory 8GB --disk-size 50GB

# Create a Linux VM
lume create my-linux-vm --os linux --cpu 2 --memory 4GB
```

> **Disk Space**: The actual disk space used by sparse images will be much lower than the logical size listed. You can resize VM disks after creation using `lume set <name> --disk-size <size>`.
